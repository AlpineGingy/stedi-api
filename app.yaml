# The kind is the type of Kubernetes resouce we are using
# A deployment is when we run code on a server
kind: Deployment
# Metadata is information related to the object we created in Kubernetes
metadata:
# The name here is the name of our deployment
  name: stedi-andruw
spec:
# Replicas refers to the number of pods we deploy
  replicas: 1
# A selector is a route to my pod
  selector:
# Matchlabels are a label for my selector
    matchLabels:
# App is a specific kind of label for my pod
      app: stedi-andruw
# The template describes all the feature of my pod
  template:
# The metadata provides labels for my template
    metadata:
      labels:

# The spec refers to the specifications of my containers in my pod    
    spec:
# Containers can have one or more Docker containers in the pod
      containers:
# The name of the container is specified below
        - name: stedi-andruw
# The image is a prebuilt file containing the operating system

# The ports is a list of tcp ports the pod listens on
          ports:
# The container port is a specific port the pod listens on
            - containerPort: 80
# Resources are the compute resources used by the pod in the cloud
          resources:
# Limits represent the max amount of CPU that can be used by the pod
            limits:
# CPU is the max amount of CPU tha can be used by the pod
              cpu: ".15"
# Memory is the max memory used
              memory: "500Mi"
# Request is the minimum amount of compute resouces used my the pod
            requests:
# Minimum cpu pod needs to run

# Same but for memory
              memory: "250Mi"
# LivenessProbe is a configuration that checcks the pod for health
          livenessProbe:
# HttpGet instructs kubernetes to do an HTTP request to check health
            httpGet:
# Path defines the url to use when doing HTTP request

# Port defines the port to use when doing the HTTP request

# initialDelaySeconds tells Kubernnetes to wait before doing a request
            initialDelaySeconds: 3
# periodSeconds tells Kubernetes how often to check health
            periodSeconds: 3

kind: Service
# metadata contains attributes about object

    app: stedi-andruw
# type tells kube the type of service we want
# a LoadBalancer distributes network packets to one or more pods
